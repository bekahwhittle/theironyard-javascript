### Expectations

* Build a game of Jeopardy!
* Using a fresh clone of the webpack-starter
* You should include:
  * a 'start page' to add your name before starting to play.
  * a game board with 6 categories, each category containing 5 questions worth 200, 400, 600, 800, 1000 points
  * a question page or modal that shows the question when you click on it in the game board.
  * an input field to type in the correct answer.
  * a total point value for how many points you've received.
* Think about how many components you will have.
* Think about what state will need to exist outside your components and in the store's application state.

### Planning

* Questions
  * What components do you want to make?
  * What different things will the components do?
  * Do they have any special methods on them?
  * What data do you need from the API?
  * How will you get it? (Hint: Actions and the Store)
