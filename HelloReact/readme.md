# React Intro

Building a simple blog using React components.

### Expectations

* Create the UI for a blogging application using multiple react components.
  * The page should have 5 blog posts already on it, made with static data. Like we did in codepen today.
* There should be a top level App component.
* There should be a component that represents a single blog post or article.
  * The data to render the post's body, title, and publish data should be props that are passed in
* There should be a component that represents a 'new post' form.
  * There should be an input for title, and a text area for body.
* Each post component should be able to be collapsed via a button in the component using local state.

### Planning

* Create a blog post component.
* Create a `hide` button to close paragraphs.
* Create an input area for new blog posts.

### Challenges

Learning new syntax for React and the logic behind hiding the post were challenges!
